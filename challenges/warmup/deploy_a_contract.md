# Deploy a contract
<sup>WARMUP: 50 POINTS</sup>

You don’t need to do anything with the contract once it’s deployed. Just click the “Check Solution” button to verify that you deployed successfully.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.21;

contract DeployChallenge {
    // This tells the CaptureTheFlag contract that the challenge is complete.
    function isComplete() public pure returns (bool) {
        return true;
    }
}
```
